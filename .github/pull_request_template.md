- [ ] **Tests** pass: `terraform apply` (see [Test Environment Setup](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-docs-samples/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#set-up-the-test-environment))
- [ ] **Lint** pass: `terraform fmt` check (see [Linting and Formating](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-docs-samples/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#linting-and-formatting))
- [ ] These samples need a new **API enabled** in testing projects to pass and I updated the [Test setup file](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-docs-samples/blob/main/test/setup/main.tf) with the APIs to be enabled
- [ ] This sample adds a new sample directory and I updated the [CODEOWNERS file](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-docs-samples/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS) with the codeowners for this sample
- [ ] Please **merge** this PR for me once it is approved.
